/**
 * Typographic fallback per `04 §8`. No stock portraits: an image of an
 * identifiable person implying they work here is a lie, and an honest gap reads
 * better than one. The demo portraits that shipped in the first build were
 * exactly that lie, and are gone; the monogram treatment stands in until the
 * firm supplies real photographs, which drop in through `avatar`. Add `name`,
 * `credentials` and `linkedin` as the firm supplies them and the cards render
 * them without further change.
 *
 * `verified` separates the one real entry from the rest. James Kamindo is the
 * firm's own point of contact and his card carries only what the contact page
 * already publishes: a name, a role and the published email. No credentials are
 * asserted for him, because none have been supplied and inventing them for a
 * real person is the failure this file exists to avoid.
 *
 * **The other three entries are demo data.** Fabricated names and credentials,
 * kept at the client's instruction for presentation, to be replaced with real
 * people before the site reaches a real audience.
